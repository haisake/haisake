Hi, I’m @haisake

I’m a perscriptive analytics expert by trade with a strong background in SQL environments.
I've been learning github off the side of my desk for about 3 years.
My goal is to create a Github and blog portfolio to showcase what I can do.

My profile pictures is the result of a bug in a network analysis I was working on in iGraph.
It's the most beautiful error I've ever made. 

Thanks for visting my github page,

Haisake
