Hi, I’m @haisake

I’m a Data Scientist who works in a Health Care Environment.
I have a background with SQL development, R development, and Operations Research analysis techniques.
I've been learning github and version control as a bit of a side thing.

My profile picture is the result of a bug in a network analysis I was working on in iGraph.
It's the most beautiful error I've ever made. 

Thanks for visting my github page,

Haisake
